Thesis: A.I. in Video Games

AI have alwayes been a subject that always intreegd me but never really hade the time to explore fully and this fact made it a perfect opertunity to dive into it.

Term A.I. have two definistions:

    - Artificial Intelligence: The most common term for what people think of when we say A.I.

    - Algorithmic Intelligence. This is probobly the closest correct term for what A.I. is in video games

True Artificial Intelligence is overkill for video games. It's only need to minic intelligence to make it feel alive.

My goal with my thesis is to use several A.I. patters that see use in video games and try to explain it's Advantadges and disadvantages.
I will also talk about information gathering using ChatGPT and the dangers about blindly following what its say/show.
