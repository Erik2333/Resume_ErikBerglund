  <h1> Personal Project </h1>
      <p>
        These are project that i have planned out for my personal growth as a game dev. <br>
      </p>
  <h2> Thesis: A.I. in Video Games </h2>
      <p> <em>
        AI have alwayes been a subject that always intreegd me but never really hade the time to explore fully and this fact made it a perfect opertunity to dive into it. </em> <br><br>
        Term A.I. have two meanings: <br>
        The most common term for what people think of when we say A.I. is Artificial Intelligence. <br>
        However, there is another term for it: <em> Algorithmic Intelligence. </em> <br>
        When you do a closer look at video game "A.I.", Algorithmic Intelligence is a more correct term for what we see in video games since Artificial Intelligence is in most cases is             overkill for what is needs in video games.
        <br>
        <br>
        My goal with my Thesis is to explain the diffrences between the two and why it's matters when talking about video game AI. <br>
