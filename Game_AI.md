  <h1> A.I. in Video Games </h1>
      <p> <em>
        AI have alwayes been a subject that always intreegd me but never really hade the time to explore fully and this fact made it a perfect opertunity to dive into it. </em> <br><br>
        Term A.I. have two definistions: <br>
          <ul>
           <li> Artificial Intelligence: </em> The most common term for what people think of when we say A.I. </li>
           <li> Algorithmic Intelligence.</em> This is probobly the closest correct term for what A.I. is in video games  </li>
          </ul>

        True Artificial Intelligence is overkill for video games. It's only need to minic intelligence to make it feel alive. <br>
        <br>
        My goal with my project is to use several A.I. patters that see use in video games and try to explain it's Advantadges and disadvantages. <br>
        I will also talk about information gathering using ChatGPT and the dangers about blindly following what its say/show. <br>
