    <h2> <em> Level Desine </em> </h2>
        <p> We feelt that good level desine was important and early gameplay had players falling of platforms to manny times in early testing. </p>
        <p> I took the time to explore the players movement and how platforms needed to be placed to ensure players can be more in control of there jumps. </p>
        <p> One of the first things i did was to make a test level and place platforms at equal distance to ensure i could perfectly understand jump distance, how they fall and what cool stuff i could imploment. Sadly they dicided to change the characters movement so the test level stopped working.Thankfully I had what I needed to continue. </p>
