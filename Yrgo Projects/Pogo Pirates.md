    <h2> <em> Game description </em> </h2>
        <p> 
            Smash style platform fighter where your chararacter constantly jump on a pogostick. 
            <br>The Main Idea of this project was to make a easy to pick up arena fighter that new players could enjoy and quickly get to a equal footing with more experienced player.

<h2> <em> Level Desine </em> </h2>
        <p> We feelt that good level desine was important and early gameplay had players falling of platforms to manny times in early testing. </p>
        <p> I took the time to explore the players movement and how platforms needed to be placed to ensure players can be more in control of there jumps. </p>
        <p> One of the first things i did was to make a test level and place platforms at equal distance to ensure i could perfectly understand jump distance, how they fall and what cool stuff i could imploment.

        <p> After i was happy with it i started figureing out our second map "Ship". After several tests we where happy with it. </p>
        <p> After that i was let lose to experiment with other map conseps like Swinging, Rotating and Moving platforms to make new ideas for maps. In the end we only had time for one of them and that led to "Misty" where we have a moving waterwheel with 4 moving platform.</p>

<h2> <em> Audio Implumentation </em> </h2>
        <p> It basically started with "how is going to implement sounds?" and after some discussion it was decided that I had the most time to dedicate to it. </p>
        <p> It started with understanding the Unity audio system, then getting  </p>
