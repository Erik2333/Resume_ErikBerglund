    <h2> <em> Level Desine and Testing </em> </h2>
        <p> We feelt that good level desine was important and early gameplay had players falling of platforms to manny times in early testing. </p>
        <p> I took the time to explore the players movement and how platforms needed to be placed to ensure players can be more in control of there jumps. </p>
        <p> One of the first things i did was to make a test level and place platforms at equal distance to ensure i cude perfectly understand </p>
