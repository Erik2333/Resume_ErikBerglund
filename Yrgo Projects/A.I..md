<h1> Thesis: A.I. in Video Games </h1>
      <p> 
        <em> AI have alwayes been a subject that always intreegd me but never really hade the time to explore fully and this fact made it a perfect opertunity to dive into it.</em>
      </p>
      <p> Term A.I. have two definistions: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> <em> Artificial Intelligence: </em> The most common term for what people think of when we say A.I. </li>
          <li> <em> Algorithmic Intelligence.</em> This is probobly the closest correct term for what A.I. is in video games  </em> </li>
        </ul>
      <p> True Artificial Intelligence is overkill for video games. It's only need to minic intelligence to make it feel alive. <br>
        My goal with my thesis is to use several A.I. patters that see use in video games and try to explain it's Advantadges and disadvantages with each pattern. 
      </p>
      <p> Hint: It's mostly about Time vs. Scalability. </p> 
      <p> I will also talk about the dangers of not checking information sources and how to gather information in a responsable way using ChatGPT. </p>
