Welcome to My Portfolio!

My name is Erik Berglund and I'm a Man in my early 30s.

Video games have always had a special place in my heart since I first played Castlevania and Super Mario Bros on the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System).

Now that I have spent a year at Yrgo studying and making games and I now know without a doubt that I what to develop games for the rest of my life.
